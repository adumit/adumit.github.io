Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Andrew Dumit. I mostly write about deep learning, both paper reads as well as some of my own thinking, but sometimes I'll write about other things as well. 
This site is mostly for me to do more of my thinking and writing in public, but if you find something useful, I'd love to hear from you!

I currently manage the Data Science team at Buoy Health Inc., a health-tech startup whose mission is to be the best place to get better. I was the founding member of the data science team and while at Buoy, I've contributed significantly to the Buoy Assistant chatbot - both the backend systems as well as the AI and ML models that power it. I continue to work on the efficacy of Buoy Assistant as well as Buoy's marketplace product towards making healthcare shoppable.
